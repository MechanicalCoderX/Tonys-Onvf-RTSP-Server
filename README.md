# Tonys Onvif-RTSP Server v4.0

A robust Virtual ONVIF-RTSP Gateway designed to bridge incompatible cameras into NVRs like UniFi Protect. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Platform Optimization & Limitations:**
> * **Ubuntu 25.04 Optimized**: This application is specifically optimized for Ubuntu 25.04.
> * **Linux Exclusive Features**: The **Virtual NIC (Unique IP & MAC Address)** feature uses `macvlan` and is **ONLY available on Linux**.
> * **Windows Limitation**: The Virtual NIC feature is **NOT available on Windows**. Multiple cameras will share the same host IP on Windows.
> * **Virtualization Requirement**: If you are running this server inside a Virtual Machine (ESXi, Proxmox, VirtualBox, etc.), you **MUST enable Promiscuous Mode** on the network interface and port group for `macvlan` (Virtual NIC) to function correctly.
* **Transcoding Alert**: Enabling live transcoding is **extremely resource-intensive** (high CPU usage) and is **not recommended** for multiple cameras unless strictly required for codec compatibility.

## 🌟 Key Features
- **NVR Compatibility**: Specifically optimized for UniFi Protect, providing the unique MAC addresses and Serial Numbers required for seamless integration.
- **Unique Virtual NICs**: Full support for Linux MACVLAN to assign unique hardware identities to each virtual camera.
- **High Performance**: Built on MediaMTX for stable, low-latency HLS and RTSP streaming.
- **Live Transcoding**: Built-in FFmpeg integration to resize or re-encode streams on the fly. *(Note: Transcoding is very resource-intensive and not recommended unless necessary for compatibility).*
- **Premium Web UI**: Modern, responsive dashboard with multiple themes and a real-time "Matrix View" for monitoring all cameras.
- **Resource Management**: Optimized for high-concurrency with automated file descriptor management to prevent "Too many open files" errors.

## 🚀 Installation & Setup (Ubuntu 25.04)

### 1. Clone the Repository
Open your terminal and run the following commands to download the code and enter the project folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BigTonyTones/Tonys-Onvf-RTSP-Server.git
cd "Tonys-Onvf-RTSP-Server"
```
*(Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_REPOSITORY_URL` with your actual GitHub link)*

### 2. Prepare the Startup Script
The project includes a startup script that automates the installation of Python dependencies and optimizes system limits for high-performance streaming. 

Give the script permission to execute:
```bash
chmod +x start_ubuntu_25.sh
```

### 3. Start the Server
Run the script to initialize the environment and launch the application:
```bash
./start_ubuntu_25.sh
```

**What this script handles for you:**
*   Installs `python3-full` and `python3-venv` only if they aren't already on your system.
*   Sets up an isolated Python Virtual Environment (`venv`).
*   Installs all required Python libraries.
*   **Performance Tuning:** Automatically increases the system file descriptor limit (`ulimit -n 65535`), which is required to prevent "Too many open files" errors when running many cameras.

### 4. Access the Web UI
Once the script finishes, it will provide a link (usually `http://localhost:5552`). Open this in your browser to begin adding your cameras.

### 5. Enable Auto-Boot (Optional)
To make your ONVIF server start automatically when your Ubuntu machine restarts:
1.  In the Web UI, go to **Settings**.
2.  Toggle **"Auto-start on System Boot (Ubuntu Service)"**.
3.  Enter your `sudo` password in the terminal when prompted to install the systemd service.

## 🪟 Windows Setup
1. Ensure Python 3.7+ is installed and in your PATH.
2. Run `start_onvif_server.bat`.
3. The script will automatically download the Windows versions of MediaMTX and FFmpeg if they are not present.

**Note**: The "Virtual NIC" (Unique IP/MAC) feature is not supported on Windows. All virtual cameras will be accessed via the host's IP address on different ONVIF ports.

## 🌐 Networking & UniFi Protect
To ensure Ubiquiti Protect treats your virtual cameras as separate devices:
- **On Linux**: Use the "Virtual NIC" feature in the camera settings. This uses `macvlan` to grant each camera its own IP and MAC address on your physical network.
- **I-Frame Intervals**: If you see "segment duration changed" warnings in your logs, disable "Smart Codec" or "H.264+" on your physical cameras and set a fixed I-Frame interval (GOP) that matches your frame rate.
